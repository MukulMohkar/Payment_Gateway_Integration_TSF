        The coronavirus pandemic has made life difficult for the poorest
        population in the world as the economic crisis triggered by it has led
        to a sharp rise in income inequality. The report, titled ‘The Inequality
        Virus’, indicated how the pandemic made the rich even richer, while the
        poor population suffered.
      </p>

      <p  class="para-text">
        On the other hand, over 1.70 lakh people lost jobs every hour during the
        month o April 2020, according to the report. The Centre For Monitoring
        Economic Research, a Mumbai-based think tank, has often pointed out that
        the employment outlook is not improving even as the country’s economy
        recovers.
      </p>

      <p  class="para-text">
        During the initial months of the pandemic, most of the job losses were
        from the informal sector, which is still struggling. The Oxfam report
        suggested that 75 per cent or over 9 crore of 12.2 josh lost due to the
        pandemic were from the informal sector, where income levels are already
        low.
      </p>

      <p  class="para-text">
        Not just jobs and income, but inequalities have also increased in other
        areas such as healthcare and education during the pandemic.
      </p>

      <p  class="para-text">
        Access to education for India’s poorest population has reduced with
        online education replacing physical classes. The report noted that just
        three per cent of the poorest 20 per cent of Indian households had
        access to a computer, while just nine per cent had access to an internet
        connection.
      </p>
      <p  class="para-text">
        The Oxfam report also noted that 6 per cent of the poorest 20 per cent
        households had access to non-shared sources of improved sanitation,
        compared to 93 per cent of the top 20 per cent households in the
        country.
      </p>
      <p  class="para-text">
        “The spread of disease was swift among poor communities, often living in
        crammed areas with poor sanitation and using shared common facilities
        such as toilets and water points,” it said.
      </p>
      <p  class="para-text">
        Experts have already said that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused
        permanent damage to the country’s poorer population and only higher
        spending by the government can help them recover.
